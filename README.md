This is a Flask web application about answering Math and Chemistry problems using AzureOpenAI. 
The Math section can take photos through a webcam and is able to solve problems when it captures a photo of a math problem. The Chemistry page can both answer questions using text chat or through web like the Math app. 
Currently I'm working on making the Math app more like the Chemisty page while also adding more subjects to the web app.
To run this application you must run the App.py.
